To serve web content, such as a web site to a web browser, a web server needs to be installed and configured.  [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is one of these types of web servers.

In order to use [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), the following prerequisites will be needed in order to get started.

1. Personal computer, running a linux distribution, and supporting peripherals to permit personal usage of the computer.  Not all are required, only what is needed for your personal setup:
   - Monitor
   - Keyboard
   - Mouse
   - Power supply

Although linux is mentioned, many other operating systems (OS) will also work.  This guide, however, was written in the context of using either the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) OS or the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) specifically.
